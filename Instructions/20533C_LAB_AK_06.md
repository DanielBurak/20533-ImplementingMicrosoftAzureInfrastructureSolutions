4. On the taskbar, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then click **Run ISE as Administrator**. Click **Yes** when prompted.

5. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, if the script pane is not visible, click **View** and then, in the **View** menu, click **Show Script Pane**.

6. In the script pane, type `Set-Location -Path 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy'` and then press the **F5** key.

6. In the console pane, type `.\AzCopy /?` and then press Enter.

7. View the syntax information displayed in the console pane. 



#### Task 3: Use AzCopy to upload blobs
  
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, in the script pane, type:
  ```
  .\AzCopy /Dest:https://<Your-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/asset-images /destkey:<Your-access-key> /Source:D:\Labfiles\Lab06\Starter\asset-images
  ```

2. Switch to the Internet Explorer window displaying the Azure portal, scroll back to the blade for your storage account, and click **Access keys**.

3. On the access keys blade, click the **Click to copy** icon next to **Storage account name**. If prompted to allow access to Clipboard, click **Allow access**.

4. Switch to the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window and replace the `<Your-storage-account>` entry with the content of Clipboard.

5. Switch to the Internet Explorer window and, on the access keys blade, click the **Click to copy** icon next to **key1**. 

6. Switch to the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window and replace the `<Your-access-key>` entry with the content of Clipboard.

7. Press the **F5** key to execute the command in the script pane.

8. Examine the output in the console pane and verify that the content of the D:\\Labfiles\\Lab06\\Starter\\asset-images folder was copied to the Azure Storage account container **asset-images**.

9. In the Azure portal, on the storage account blade, click **Overview**.

10. In the **Services** section of the blade, click the **Blobs** tile.

11. On the **Blob service** blade, click the **asset-images** container.

12. On the **asset-images** blade, verify that there are six new blobs.

8. Review the script, noting that it:

  - Sets the values of variables named **$shareName** and **$directoryName** for the file share and the directory to create in the Azure Storage account
	
  - Uses the **Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey** cmdlet to retrieve the access key for your storage account.

  - Uses the **New-AzureStorageContext** cmdlet to create a security context for connections to the target storage account based on the key you retrieved

  - Uses the **New-AzureStorageShare** cmdlet to create an Azure Storage account file share

  - Uses the **New-AzureStorageDirectory** cmdlet to create a directory in the share

  - Sets the location of the folder hosting source files to be copied to the Azure Storage file share directory

  - Loops through the files in the source folder and uses the **Set-AzureStorageFileContent** cmdlet to copy each of them the folder in the Azure file share.

9. Save the script and then press the **F5** key.

10. Observe the script as it runs, and then view the output. When you finish, close Windows PowerShell ISE.



#### Task 2: Access a file share from a VM

3. In the AdatumSvr06 Remote Desktop window, click the **Internet Explorer** icon on the taskbar. If prompted to set up Internet Explorer, ensure that the **Use recommended security, privacy, and compatibility settings** option is selected, and then click **OK**.

4. Browse to **https://portal.azure.com**, and then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.

6. In the **Hub** menu, click **More services**, and then click **Storage accounts**.

7. On the **Storage accounts** blade, click the storage account that you created in the previous exercise, and then on the blade for your storage account, click the **Files** tile.

10. On the **Connect** blade, select the code appearing in the **Connecting from Windows** section, right-click on it, and, in the right-click menu, click **Copy**.

11. Click **Start**, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, in the right-click menu, click **More** and click **Run as administrator**. 

12. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, if the script pane is not visible, click **View** and then, in the **View** menu, click **Show Script Pane**.

13. In the script pane, paste the content of Clipboard. 

14. In the script pane, remove the leading `> ` characters, such that the line starts with `net use`.

15. In the command line you copied, replace `[drive letter]` with `*`.

16. Verify that the command executed successfully, resulting in creation of the **Z:** drive mapping. 

17. In the console pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, run the following command to view the contents of the invoices folder on the Z: drive, which is now mapped to the assets file share that you created in a previous task:

  ```
  Get-ChildItem -Path 'Z:\invoices'
  ```

18. Verify that invoice documents are listed.

19. Close the Windows PowerShell ISE window and Internet Explorer, and then sign out of the Remote Desktop session to AdatumSvr06.

> **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have created an Azure storage account file share named **assets** that contains a folder named **invoices** with copies of invoice documents. You should have also mapped a drive from an Azure VM to the Azure storage account file share.

5. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one that you want to target with the script.

6. When prompted for confirmation, type **y** and press Enter.

> **Note:** This script will remove Azure services in your subscription. We therefore recommended that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
>  The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Azure environment, ready for the next lab. 
>  The script removes all storage, virtual machines, virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups.
> **Note:** **Important**: The script might not be able to access a storage account to delete it (if this occurs, you will see an error). If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the **Reset-Azure** script, or you can use the Azure portal and the Azure classic portal to delete all the objects in your Azure subscription manuallyâ€”with the exception of the default directory.

> **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have created an Azure Recovery Services vault in your subscription, downloaded vault credentials, and installed the Azure Recovery Services agent on the MIA-CL1 lab computer. You should have backed up the contents of the asset-images and invoices folders to the Recovery Services vault.
