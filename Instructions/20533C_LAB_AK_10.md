## Exercise 2: Managing synchonization
  
#### Task 1: Modify attributes of an Active Directory user and Initiate manual synchronization
  
1. In the Remote Desktop Session to adVM, click **Start**, right-click **Windows PowerShell ISE**, click **More**, and click **Run as administrator**.

2. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, type the following and press **Enter**:

  ```
  $user = Get-ADUser -Filter "SamAccountName -eq 'bbeach'" -Properties Department,Title -SearchBase 'OU=AccountsToSync,DC=adatum,DC=com'
  $user | Get-ADUser -Properties Department,Title
  ```

3. Note the current values of the **Title** and **Department** properties.

4. In the console of the Windows PowerShell ISE window, type the following commands and, after each one, press **Enter**:
  ```
  $user | Set-ADUser -Title 'VP' -Department 'Marketing'
  $user | Get-ADUser -Properties Department,Title
  ```

5. Verify that the values of the **Title** and **Department** properties have changed.

6. In the console pane of the Windows PowerShell ISE, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:
  ```
  Get-ADSyncScheduler
  ```
> **Note:** **Get-ADSyncScheduler** displays the current configuration settings for synchronization with Azure AD.
> **Note:** If the command **GET-ADSyncScheduler** is not found, you may have to manually import the Azure AD Connect powershell module by using the following command : **Import-Module "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft AZure AD Sync\\Bin\\ADSync\\ADSync.psd1"**

7. At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
  ```

8. Wait until synchronization completes before proceeding to the next step.

9. Switch back to the Azure portal in the Internet Explorer window.

10. In the Azure portal, on the **AdatumSync** blade, on the **Users and groups - All Users** blade, click **Beverly Beach**

11. In the **Overview** section of the **Beverly beach** blade, verify that the values of the **Department** and **Job title** entries match the ones you configured for the Active Directory account. If you do not see any changes, wait for a few minutes, and then refresh the page.

12. Close the adVM remote desktop session, and click **OK** when prompted.



#### Task 2: Reset the environment
  
1. On MIA-CL1, close all open applications without saving any files.

2. On the taskbar, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then click **Run as administrator**. 

3. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**.

4. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Reset-Azure 
  ```

5. When prompted (twice), sign in by using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

6. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want the script to target.

7. When prompted for confirmation, type **y**.

> **Note:** This script might remove Azure services in your subscription. We therefore recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Azure environment and make it ready for the next module. 
> The script removes all storage, virtual machines, virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups.
> **Important:** The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it; if this occurs, you will see an error. If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the **Reset-Azure** script, or you can use the Azure classic portal to delete all the objects in your Azure subscription manually, with the exception of the default directory.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have changed attributes on a user account, and then forced synchronization.
